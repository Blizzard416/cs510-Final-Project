    "ReviewText": "If you're searching for this, you know what it is. My gas range is the standard 36\" range with built-in oven that is found in many homes. Nothing fancy. The problem is that there is a small gap between the range and the cabinet/countertop that food or liquid can fall into. These Stainless Steel Stove Gap Covers solves exactly this problem. Due to its proximity to the fire and heat, the gap cover must be metal and because will be exposed to oils and other food particles, it needs to be easy-to-clean. These covers fit both criteria. With an extendable piece, these covers can fit all ranges regardless of the depth of the stove and there is a small metal piece that is supposed to provide tension when inserted into the gap. Unfortunately, this is where I have the first problem with this product. The tension just isn't enough to keep the gap cover in the gap snugly. I think a cork or silicone piece would help give it the friction in needs to stay in place. The second problem I have is that the product is in the shape of the letter \"T\" but because there is a slight difference in height between my range and the counter, it has to tilt to one side, further making it hard for the cover to stay in place. The last issue is the extension part. It doesn't lock into a position. Without it, you can accidentally push on the cover and shorten it. It would be better to have some sort of locking mechanism that will keep it to the length that you set. This product does what its intended for, but I think a few tweaks and it would be perfect (I might just look to see if I can make these tweaks myself).",

The wick length and height are the same as the original, but not quite as thick as the OEM filter. The thickness obviously allows it hold and wick away more moisture, so these filters, while a little bit less expensive aren't as effective. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend these as a reliable replacement for my OEM MAF1 filter. I'd be better off spending a few dollars more to save more in the long run.

The burners are a bit too powerful for the home cook IMHO. Something I've noticed is that the burners will heat food unevenly, as in a cast iron pan of scrambled eggs will cook faster on one side. This is without any fan on in the kitchen. Does that sound right to you? So I have to rotate pans 180 degrees. This is annoying. There's a tiny burner at the center of the right burner which I couldn't figure out, then eventually turned the tiny cap a bit and it lit and stayed on. It's actually kind of useful. The oven racks SUCK, they're impossible to pull in and out, they have odd little metal balls that just do not cooperate, major fail.

I had been using the regular fluted, paper filters that fit in drip coffee makers. I thought these little round filters would work better since they already have the center hole punched in them. After using both though, I've decided to stick with what I had been using, the fluted, filters for drip coffee makers because they seem to do a better job and are less expensive. Yes, I have to push the filter onto the center tube but that's not a big deal. I find that it's much easier to clean the basket when I use the regular drip style filters. With the round ones, the grounds stick to the sides of the basket and I have to scrap them off with the side of my finger to get them off before I wash the basket.

I normally use a clip that lets me use any old cup, but it doesn’t work for the carafe size cups as they require a different color, so I had to remove it from my machine. Coffee tastes good and they were fairly easy to clean. I just wish it was a bit less fiddly.

This looked just like what I needed, so I got it. It has a lot of good features: super easy to use and clean, and it looks nice too, and doesn't take up too much space. The screen is very fine, so no coffee grounds got through. The screen is so fine--yet works so well--that I suspect I could even use this on rooibos tea, which is very fine indeed. On to the problems. The silicone (rubber?) ring around the base was half off when it came out of the package. I couldn't get it back on. It doesn't really matter in terms of operation, but kind of not a good idea to have something breaking right out of the package. I also don't get why the coffee scoop has a brush on the end of it. For cleaning the screen I guess, but it seems odd to me to have it on the end of the coffee scoop, and frankly, it didn't help with cleaning it all (but the mesh did just rinse clean). I don't really see this thing lasting that long. Finally, as others have noted, it makes a fairly weak cup of coffee. I have another cup filter like this that doesn't start filtering until you put it on the cup, which means you can let it brew a longer. I much prefer that filter to this one, although that one uses disposable filters. There may be a trick to learning to do a good pour-over, so perhaps my complaints reflect that, but for now, I think I'll keep using my other filter with the new reusable linen filters I found on Amazon. I might use this to filter tea after I've steeped it in a pot--it is a great fine mesh filter. But overall, this doesn't quite suit my needs.",

The SS-700 lasted almost 6 1/2 years, which is far better than my earlier 1 cup units. Unfortunately, I have to say the SS-700 was better. For one thing, when you close the SS-10's handle on a K-cup, it feels and sounds like the mechanism is about to break. It feels flimsy. Plus, the SS-700 allowed you to select a brewing temperature between 187 and 192 degrees F, and the coffee was HOT. The SS-10 has only HOT and XHOT selections and, sadly, even with the XHOT setting the coffee temp measures only 140 degrees. Once I add creamer it's down to 130. That's barely warm. In just a few minutes I'm looking to nuke the cup in the microwave. On a lesser note, I miss the SS-700's blue LEDs shining up into the water reservoir, making it easier to see the current level. And did I mention the SS-10 holds 10% less water? On the plus side, the SS-10 is quieter than the SS-700, but who really cares?",

I have ADHD and am not great at making sure my laundry is worked on daily, so I accumulate a pile of cloths by the end of the week. If you are also thinking of using this product as a 'weekly' tool instead of a 'daily' tool, buyer beware! The sheer volume of labor this creates is just not worth it. If you are actually on top of it, and doing your daily laundry every single day, this product will be legit. This product is also very useful is you are moving around a lot, travelling (with space for it and electricity) or perhaps limited access to a Laundry place. I bought it during the heat of Covid, and I never use it anymore. With my ~$1 Per Load price that my old apartment building offered, I think I would have needed to do laundry for a least one whole year to justify this price. I now have in-unit Washer/Dryer but am hesitant to just sell this due to the price I paid. But if you are thinking, 'I'll just use this weekly instead of going to the Laundromat' - you will eventually go back to the Laundromat.

I bought this online as I needed something with about a 4-inch height and no solutions were available at the local hardware store. The problem with this design, as you can see, is when you adjust to the lower heights, the extra length you're sliding out the bottom adds to the minimum height requirement from the floor, and this action pushed the vent too high to secure to the rear of the dryer. The modification was simple enough - I only had to cut off the extra length with a heavy-duty scissors, but this resulted in a jagged bottom edge during adjustment. I don't really see how they can claim it will work for 0-6 inches as shipped, and they should instead offer maybe a 0-6, 6-12, 12-18 inch selection.",

  "ReviewText": "Had to return it for a replacement (but the replacement unit is pretty good). I needed to replace my old 19 CF refrigerator, and needed that size again because of the space in my kitchen, and there are only 3 models sold with bottom draw freezer in that size: Kenmore, Maytag and Whirlpool. Based on pictures they all look the same, but Consumer Reports rated Kenmore highest, and it was also least expensive so this is the one I decided on. I bought it on Amazon because it had quicker delivery than directly from Sears, and same price but included free hookup including ice-maker and free haul-away of the old unit. First the negatives: I needed a left-hand door, and the refrigerator typically is set up right-hand, but designed for easy change in the distribution center before delivery. It was really hard to figure out how to specify left-hand door with the Amazon order. I ultimately had to call 3 times to get someone to confirm it would be done left-hand. Second, when it was delivered the door had been damaged when the handle position was moved. Initially I agreed to have Kenmore send the parts to replace the door, but then thought better of it and accepted Amazon's offer to replace the whole refrigerator. I have decided not to post the photos here of the damage it was delivered with, since ultimately they made it right. Third, while waiting for the replacement unit, the refrigerator started making a grinding/crackling sound coming from the back of the unit (not inside) that clearly indicated something important was wrong. I didn't explore further since we were getting a replacement anyway. Both Amazon and Kenmore were very responsive re customer service, and I cannot say enough positive about the people - one at each place - who helped make things right. But still it was a pain. Regarding the refrigerator itself: It works well and keeps food cold. Ice-maker is working great so far. For a small refrigerator like this, having the pull-out drawer on the bottom is really great. Compared to my older unit (which was GE, but they no longer make this size) it has a much larger freezer space, but much smaller refrigerator space. The larger freezer space is nice, but I much prefer the larger refrigerator to freezer space. THis is really a small refrigerator unit. Finally, the temperature controller and light is at the top front of the refrigerator compartment - so it blocks moving things in and out easily. Its a surprisingly bad design that makes a small space even less usable - but from what I can see all 3 of the brands available are identical in the refrigerator/freezer space ratio and in placement of the thermostat/light. So if 19 CF bottom freezer is what you want, that is all that's available. The exterior design is OK. There are 2 plastic plugs on the outside of the door that are pretty unsightly - its a really cheesy design to cover the holes for swapping the handle. There are 2 crispers with adjustable humidity and a meat/deli drawer. They are nice to have, but pretty cheap quality plastic (although seems to me that is standard). The door shelves are OK, although there is some wasted space in the design. But again, I think all the brands available in this size with bottom freezer drawer are identical.",

I set a towel under it and decided to see if it would stop. After a full day of using it, a soaked towel, and being just about fed up it did finally stop leaking. I love the price, I'm curious to try the next filter, and I might buy again...but you do get what you pay for and I wouldn't put these at the same level as the samsung brand. Having said that, now that it is installed and has stopped leaking there really are no problems with it.",

My vehicle will idle at about 14.5 volts, so it is able to put more power into the heater, so it boils water slightly faster. When the product description says 'glass or ceramic' container, they mean it. If you try to use a metal container, the metal will radiate and waste heat. If you try to use something silly like foam plastic, it will likely melt. Plus, you want to choose the container volume carefully. If you use a large volume container, the heater coil will not sink down into the cold water far enough, so the whole thing will burn up and fail. We are trying to get some volume around 8 ounces to boil. If you try it with 6 ounces of cold water, it will boil relatively quickly. I found that I could get good results (about 8 minutes to boil) using 7 ounces of water in a glass/ceramic mug, and the heater coil sticks down into the cold water. YMMV. If your vehicle battery is different and if you have the heater plugged into a socket that is a long way from the battery over a poor choice of wire, then the power to the heater will be lower. Just don't make the mistake of letting the heater flip off of the mug lip. Then it will be out of the water, it will burn up, and fail. So, choose your pieces and parts carefully.",

  "ReviewText": "This is a good replacement for the oven knob for my older Kenmore model 911-6118810 range. Seems like they discontinued making the oven knob for this range but they still make the stove knobs. Oven knobs are a bit more important then stove knobs since when you're baking you really need to know the temperature setting. I have an older 1990 Kenmore and the numbers on the oven knob eventually wipe off over the years. One of the other commenters said that you need to have a D-Style stem that is 3/8 inches wide and that is what I have so this fit. Most important thing is where the Broil word is and which way the numbers go. This is as close as i can get. So it seems to work and is close enough.",

Title doesn't say 2pk and product description doesn't say 2 pk. I just noticed under the small technical details it says quantity is 2 but since there is not much there I must have scrolled right over it several times. Would have been nice to save some money to buy just what I needed. Also shipping was kinda strange. I didn't get my product until 4 days after the estimate delivery date. Shipping label looks like it was printed but not delivered to the P.O. until a couple days later. Label on the box said priority mail but on usps site it says 2 day priority mail so I don't know. That is why i won't give it 5 stars. The product itself is fine though.",

  "ReviewText": "Spent a few hour on the prep and install to replace an old kenmore unit. Well now I think the Kenmore unit may have performed better, but looked worn out and had no style. This Broan unit ships prepped for non vented set up. The change over to vented was easy, and the mounting was typical for a replacement - nothing is as easy as you plan. Ha! But the 1st time I tested the vent fan I noticed it is spilling a lot of air out the non vent port on top of the unit. It should not be doing this at all!!!! I took it apart and tried to reseal the plastic device that is supposed to block off the non vent port - I found the plastic blocking device was seated properly. Put it back together and its only a bit better - still spilling air out the non vent port that should be totally blocked off. The seal of the plastic duct for non-vented application must not be seated properly against the weather stripping on the underside of the hood top. I guess I will have to disassemble again, and tape off the dang vent openings permanently with aluminum duct tape from the inside of the hood. Poor design - I say this unit is built for non-vented applications first. I would have paid a bit more $$ for a unit that was dedicated to ducted ventilation only, though it would be cheaper for Broan to produce a unit without the non-venting plastic duct and punched vent holes in the top of the hood.",

So I decided to try these bags and use them like a tea-bag in the press. While they do cut down on sediment, I still get some, but not nearly as much. The coffee is less \"muddy\" tasting. I do find that I need to use an extra scoop of coffee with this technique, though. I suggest adding the coffee to the bag, then tying a knot in the string to make the \"bag\" smaller. This also cuts down on escaping grounds. Cleanup is SO much better when using these bags, by the way. Ideally, a smaller size and lower price would be nice. But until I can find some like that, I will probably keep using these.",
