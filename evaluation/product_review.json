    "ReviewText": "If you're searching for this, you know what it is. My gas range is the standard 36\" range with built-in oven that is found in many homes. Nothing fancy. The problem is that there is a small gap between the range and the cabinet/countertop that food or liquid can fall into. These Stainless Steel Stove Gap Covers solves exactly this problem. Due to its proximity to the fire and heat, the gap cover must be metal and because will be exposed to oils and other food particles, it needs to be easy-to-clean. These covers fit both criteria. With an extendable piece, these covers can fit all ranges regardless of the depth of the stove and there is a small metal piece that is supposed to provide tension when inserted into the gap. Unfortunately, this is where I have the first problem with this product. The tension just isn't enough to keep the gap cover in the gap snugly. I think a cork or silicone piece would help give it the friction in needs to stay in place. The second problem I have is that the product is in the shape of the letter \"T\" but because there is a slight difference in height between my range and the counter, it has to tilt to one side, further making it hard for the cover to stay in place. The last issue is the extension part. It doesn't lock into a position. Without it, you can accidentally push on the cover and shorten it. It would be better to have some sort of locking mechanism that will keep it to the length that you set. This product does what its intended for, but I think a few tweaks and it would be perfect (I might just look to see if I can make these tweaks myself).",

Turns out the trick was to keep trying by pushing the cup as far into the holder as possible and quickly closing it. Eventually it read as compatible and didn’t give an error message. I normally use a clip that lets me use any old cup, but it doesn’t work for the carafe size cups as they require a different color, so I had to remove it from my machine. Coffee tastes good and they were fairly easy to clean. I just wish it was a bit less fiddly.

This looked just like what I needed, so I got it. It has a lot of good features: super easy to use and clean, and it looks nice too, and doesn't take up too much space. The screen is very fine, so no coffee grounds got through. The screen is so fine--yet works so well--that I suspect I could even use this on rooibos tea, which is very fine indeed. On to the problems. The silicone (rubber?) ring around the base was half off when it came out of the package. I couldn't get it back on. It doesn't really matter in terms of operation, but kind of not a good idea to have something breaking right out of the package. I also don't get why the coffee scoop has a brush on the end of it. For cleaning the screen I guess, but it seems odd to me to have it on the end of the coffee scoop, and frankly, it didn't help with cleaning it all (but the mesh did just rinse clean). I don't really see this thing lasting that long. Finally, as others have noted, it makes a fairly weak cup of coffee. I have another cup filter like this that doesn't start filtering until you put it on the cup, which means you can let it brew a longer. I much prefer that filter to this one, although that one uses disposable filters. There may be a trick to learning to do a good pour-over, so perhaps my complaints reflect that, but for now, I think I'll keep using my other filter with the new reusable linen filters I found on Amazon. I might use this to filter tea after I've steeped it in a pot--it is a great fine mesh filter. But overall, this doesn't quite suit my needs.",

The SS-700 lasted almost 6 1/2 years, which is far better than my earlier 1 cup units. Unfortunately, I have to say the SS-700 was better. For one thing, when you close the SS-10's handle on a K-cup, it feels and sounds like the mechanism is about to break. It feels flimsy. Plus, the SS-700 allowed you to select a brewing temperature between 187 and 192 degrees F, and the coffee was HOT. The SS-10 has only HOT and XHOT selections and, sadly, even with the XHOT setting the coffee temp measures only 140 degrees. Once I add creamer it's down to 130. That's barely warm. In just a few minutes I'm looking to nuke the cup in the microwave. On a lesser note, I miss the SS-700's blue LEDs shining up into the water reservoir, making it easier to see the current level. And did I mention the SS-10 holds 10% less water? On the plus side, the SS-10 is quieter than the SS-700, but who really cares?",

Multiple times I've come back to find that the door was ajar. I tested it to make sure - you have to close the door gently, so don't be in a hurry when you're grabbing a drink.

The way the bristles are angled makes the brush upside-down in a left hand.  Sure, you can use the long bristles, but that defeats the purpose of the angle which really does make the brush go through whiskers more easily.  We Southpaws are very used to this.  So many products designed to fit in a hand are made for the right hand, which makes them awkward or ineffective (like scissors) for 10% of us.  When that happens, I find that I don't reach for that item as often, or I avoid it altogether, and, sadly, this fine brush sits seldom-used in my bathroom.

I’ve had an elite controller for 3 years and never broke a back paddle mechanism. Unfortunately Amazon won’t let me return the second in a used condition. I’m out nearly $80 for a broken controller. I have no fully functional controller now and can’t afford another. Not the seller/vendors fault, but the quality control/design on these controllers is rough. Look it up on Reddit and you’ll see many with this issue. The paddles eventually either stop clicking when pressed down, or lock up and randomly can’t be pressed. Sticks are great though.",
