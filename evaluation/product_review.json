The problem is that there is a small gap between the range and the cabinet/countertop that food or liquid can fall into. These Stainless Steel Stove Gap Covers solves exactly this problem. Due to its proximity to the fire and heat, the gap cover must be metal and because will be exposed to oils and other food particles, it needs to be easy-to-clean. These covers fit both criteria. With an extendable piece, these covers can fit all ranges regardless of the depth of the stove and there is a small metal piece that is supposed to provide tension when inserted into the gap. Unfortunately, this is where I have the first problem with this product. The tension just isn't enough to keep the gap cover in the gap snugly. I think a cork or silicone piece would help give it the friction in needs to stay in place. The second problem I have is that the product is in the shape of the letter \"T\" but because there is a slight difference in height between my range and the counter, it has to tilt to one side, further making it hard for the cover to stay in place. The last issue is the extension part. It doesn't lock into a position. Without it, you can accidentally push on the cover and shorten it. It would be better to have some sort of locking mechanism that will keep it to the length that you set. This product does what its intended for, but I think a few tweaks and it would be perfect (I might just look to see if I can make these tweaks myself).",

The wick length and height are the same as the original, but not quite as thick as the OEM filter. The thickness obviously allows it hold and wick away more moisture, so these filters, while a little bit less expensive aren't as effective. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend these as a reliable replacement for my OEM MAF1 filter. I'd be better off spending a few dollars more to save more in the long run. I hope the manufacturer sees this review and considers re-working the dimensions for a proper filter.

This is without any fan on in the kitchen. Does that sound right to you? So I have to rotate pans 180 degrees. This is annoying. There's a tiny burner at the center of the right burner which I couldn't figure out, then eventually turned the tiny cap a bit and it lit and stayed on. It's actually kind of useful.

This looked just like what I needed, so I got it. It has a lot of good features: super easy to use and clean, and it looks nice too, and doesn't take up too much space. The screen is very fine, so no coffee grounds got through. The screen is so fine--yet works so well--that I suspect I could even use this on rooibos tea, which is very fine indeed. On to the problems. The silicone (rubber?) ring around the base was half off when it came out of the package. I couldn't get it back on. It doesn't really matter in terms of operation, but kind of not a good idea to have something breaking right out of the package. I also don't get why the coffee scoop has a brush on the end of it. For cleaning the screen I guess, but it seems odd to me to have it on the end of the coffee scoop, and frankly, it didn't help with cleaning it all (but the mesh did just rinse clean). I don't really see this thing lasting that long. Finally, as others have noted, it makes a fairly weak cup of coffee. I have another cup filter like this that doesn't start filtering until you put it on the cup, which means you can let it brew a longer. I much prefer that filter to this one, although that one uses disposable filters. There may be a trick to learning to do a good pour-over, so perhaps my complaints reflect that, but for now, I think I'll keep using my other filter with the new reusable linen filters I found on Amazon. I might use this to filter tea after I've steeped it in a pot--it is a great fine mesh filter. But overall, this doesn't quite suit my needs.",

The SS-700 lasted almost 6 1/2 years, which is far better than my earlier 1 cup units. Unfortunately, I have to say the SS-700 was better. For one thing, when you close the SS-10's handle on a K-cup, it feels and sounds like the mechanism is about to break. It feels flimsy. Plus, the SS-700 allowed you to select a brewing temperature between 187 and 192 degrees F, and the coffee was HOT. The SS-10 has only HOT and XHOT selections and, sadly, even with the XHOT setting the coffee temp measures only 140 degrees. Once I add creamer it's down to 130. That's barely warm. In just a few minutes I'm looking to nuke the cup in the microwave. On a lesser note, I miss the SS-700's blue LEDs shining up into the water reservoir, making it easier to see the current level. And did I mention the SS-10 holds 10% less water? On the plus side, the SS-10 is quieter than the SS-700, but who really cares?",

After that first week, it’s gradually starting to have issues such as the ice is melting in its tray. It’s in a cool area, it has proper ventilation, and my house is at a constant 69* with our AC unit, so there is no reason for this occurrence. The sensor light seems to be flickering now as well and we have to fidget with our machine to get it to begin making ice. We’ve had our product less than a month and were more than satisfied to begin with. It made me question how quickly some of the product reviews were written after their purchases because if I had reviewed the product within the first week, I would have given it 5 stars.

Seems like they discontinued making the oven knob for this range but they still make the stove knobs. Oven knobs are a bit more important then stove knobs since when you're baking you really need to know the temperature setting. I have an older 1990 Kenmore and the numbers on the oven knob eventually wipe off over the years. One of the other commenters said that you need to have a D-Style stem that is 3/8 inches wide and that is what I have so this fit. Most important thing is where the Broil word is and which way the numbers go. This is as close as i can get. So it seems to work and is close enough.",

This Broan unit ships prepped for non vented set up. The change over to vented was easy, and the mounting was typical for a replacement - nothing is as easy as you plan. Ha! But the 1st time I tested the vent fan I noticed it is spilling a lot of air out the non vent port on top of the unit. It should not be doing this at all!!!! I took it apart and tried to reseal the plastic device that is supposed to block off the non vent port - I found the plastic blocking device was seated properly. Put it back together and its only a bit better - still spilling air out the non vent port that should be totally blocked off. The seal of the plastic duct for non-vented application must not be seated properly against the weather stripping on the underside of the hood top. I guess I will have to disassemble again, and tape off the dang vent openings permanently with aluminum duct tape from the inside of the hood. Poor design - I say this unit is built for non-vented applications first. I would have paid a bit more $$ for a unit that was dedicated to ducted ventilation only, though it would be cheaper for Broan to produce a unit without the non-venting plastic duct and punched vent holes in the top of the hood.",

I do find that I need to use an extra scoop of coffee with this technique, though. I suggest adding the coffee to the bag, then tying a knot in the string to make the \"bag\" smaller.
